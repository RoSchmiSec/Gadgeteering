During BETA development & Releases please ASSUME that 
-Naming conventions might change
-The actual layout tree and names of the repository might change
-The APIs may change
	
For instance, we are planning to start on 11/6/2013 to move all 
symbol names to lower case names with an underscore between words.
Constants will be all UPPER_CASE.

On 11/6/2013 we will start re-organizing the repository in a way that
looks more like

	root
		build
		core
		examples
		mainboards
		modules
		tests
