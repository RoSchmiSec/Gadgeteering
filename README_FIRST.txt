During BETA development & Releases please ASSUME that 
    * Naming conventions might change
	* the actual layout tree and names of the repository might change
	
For instance, we are planning to start on 11/6/2013 to move all 
symbol names to lower case names with an underscore between words.
Manifest Constants will be all UPPER case.

On 11/6/2013 we will start re-organizing the repository in a way that
looks more like

      root
	  core modules tests examples contributed tools
